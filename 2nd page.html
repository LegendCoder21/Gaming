        <font face="Agency fb" size=10><b><u>Selecting the Right Game Mode</u></b></font><br>
        <font face="Agency fb" size=6>
            <ul>
                <li>Survival – after randomly being spawned in a new world, players have to try and survive by gathering material, building shelter, 
                    gaining experience, and fighting off hostile mobs.</li>
                <li>Creative – a game mode where players have immediate access to almost all blocks and items, are invulnerable & immune to death, 
                    and have the ability to fly. The purpose of this game mode is to create / design unique worlds.</li> 
                <li>Adventure – players interact with objects (levers, buttons) and mobs to complete an adventure.</li> 
                <li>Spectator – Invisible to everything and cannot interact with blocks, entities, or your inventory. This mode is typically used to 
                    observe other player’s created worlds.</li>
                <li>Hardcore – Similar to survival mode, Hardcore is set to the “hard” difficulty level permanently and players cannot respawn; 
                    once you die, the map is deleted (or you permanently become a spectator).</li>         
            </ul>
